# Object.merge(o, a, b) -> c

3-way JavaScript Object merging.

Takes 3 versions of the same object -- where version 2 and 3 are both derived from version 1 -- and generates a 4th version, effectively merging version 2 and 3 together. When a conflict is detected (changes made in both version 2 and 3) changes from version 3 are used and information about the conflict is added to the `conflicts` structure.

I wrote this for using together with [node-couchdb-min](http://github.com/rsms/node-couchdb-min) to provide conflict resolution for CouchDB documents.

## Prototype

```javascript
Object.merge(Object origin, Object versionA, Object versionB,
  Bool shallow | Object base) -> Object
```

- `origin`: Ancestor version from which both `versionA` and `versionB` is derived.

- `versionA`: Version A of `origin`

- `versionB`: Version B of `origin`

- `shallow`: (*Advanced property*) If true, only resolve values at the first level. By setting this to true, many conflicts which could be merged automatically will not be merged. However, if you only want to test if there's a possibility of conflicts, setting this to true will yield better performance. In most cases this should be false or not set. 

- `base`: (*Advanced property*) A base object on which to build the final, merged version. To be entirely sure about how to use this and what it implies, you should probably walk through the source code.


**Return value:**

`Object.merge` returns a structure which looks like this:

```javascript
{ merged: 
   { key1: 123
   , key2: 'john doe'
   , key3: [ 'abc', 'ooo', 'xyz' ]
   }
, added: 
   { a: { key1: 789 }
   , b: { key1: 123, key2: 'john doe' }
   }
, updated: 
   { a: { key3: [ 'abc', 'd,ef', 'xyz' ] }
   , b: {}
   }
, conflicts: { key1: { a: 789, o: 4, b: 123 } }
}
```

- The `merged` key contains "version 4" and is the merged result.

- The `added` key contains information about what parts where added (was not 
  present in the origin/version 1).

- The `updated` key contains information about what parts where updated (was 
  present in origin/version 1).

- If the `conflicts` key is present, there are conflicts and they are described
  by a structure `key: {a: value, o: value, b: value}` where each `value` is the
  value in each of the three versions. If the key was not present in the origin,
  `o` is not present. 

Unless `Object.merge` is called with a fourth argument with the constant `true`, conflict resolution is recursive for deep conflicts. In this case complex values (array, object) in the conflict structure will -- instead of the different values, be yet another `conflicts` structure. It might look like this:

```javascript
conflicts: {
  // Simple conflict:
  age: { 
    a: 12,  b: 13
  },
  // Conflict originates deep into a complex value:
  following: {
    conflicts: {
      // Member 'threeLetters' of the "conflicts" object is the source:
      'threeLetters': {
        a: 'xyz',  o: 'def',  b: 'ooo'
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Example:

```javascript
// The original version which both A and B are derived from.
origin = {
  name:'rsms', 
  following:['abc', 'd,ef'],
  modified:12345678,
  aliases:{'abc':'Abc'}
}
// Version A
A = {
  age:12, 
  location:'sto', 
  sex:'m', 
  name:'rsms', 
  modified:12345679,
  following:['abc', 'cat', 'xyz'],
  aliases:{'abc':'Abc', 'def':'Def'}
}
// Version B
B = {
  age:13, 
  name:'rsms', 
  sex:'m', 
  following:['abc', 'ooo'], 
  modified:12345679, 
  aliases:{'abc':'Abc', 'aab':'Aab'}
}

result = Object.merge(origin, A, B);
sys.puts('-->\n'+sys.inspect(result, false, 10));

-->
{ merged: 
   { age: 13
   , name: 'rsms'
   , sex: 'm'
   , following: [ 'abc', 'ooo', 'xyz' ]
   , modified: 12345679
   , aliases: { abc: 'Abc', aab: 'Aab', def: 'Def' }
   , location: 'sto'
   }
, added: 
   { a: { age: 12, location: 'sto', sex: 'm' }
   , b: { age: 13, sex: 'm' }
   }
, updated: 
   { a: 
      { modified: 12345679
      , following: [ 'abc', 'cat', 'xyz' ]
      , aliases: { abc: 'Abc', def: 'Def' }
      }
   , b: 
      { following: [ 'abc', 'ooo' ]
      , modified: 12345679
      , aliases: { abc: 'Abc', aab: 'Aab' }
      }
   }
, conflicts: 
   { age: { a: 12, b: 13 }
   , following: { conflicts: { '1': { a: 'cat', o: 'd,ef', b: 'ooo' } } }
   }
}
```

## Requirements

- `Array.isArray(object) -> Boolean` to be implemented (which it is already in modern JavaScript environments).
